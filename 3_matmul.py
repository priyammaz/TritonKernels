    We typically do GPU compute in blocks. Instead of having every

    For simplicity we assume that the number of rows in A are divisible by BLOCK_SIZE_M
    and the number of cols in B are divisible by BLOCK_SIZE_N
    
    
    Lets say we were doing the following matmul:

    A: [6 x 3]
    B: [3 x 8]
    C: [6 x 8] <- Output
    BLOCK_SIZE_M = 3

    Before, each c was computed by a single thread. This is pretty inefficient, so instead lets compute
    blocks of c. We already stated that the BLOCK_SIZE_M is 3 and BLOCK_SIZE_N is 4, so lets do that!

    [c11 c12 c13 c14 | c15 c16 c17 c18]    
    [c21 c22 c23 c24 | c25 c26 c27 c28]

    [c41 c42 c43 c44 | c45 c46 c47 c48]
    [c51 c52 c53 c54 | c55 c56 c57 c58]
    [c61 c62 c63 c64 | c65 c66 c67 c58]
    
    Now what we want is for every thread block to process each block of our output. In this case we will
    have 4 different blocks, which we can write as:


    [B1 B2]
    [B3 B4]

    where B1 = [c11 c12 c13 c14]    
               [c21 c22 c23 c24]
               [c31 c32 c33 c34]

               [c35 c36 c37 c38]
        
          ...


    And we can see each block refers to a block of rows and cols in our A and  respectively, for example:

    B1 = [c11 c12 c13 c14]    [a11 a12 a13]    [b11 b12 b13 b14]

    """
    Blocking our matmul is a step in the right direction as it now enables proper
    usage of our GPUs. We can distribute each threadblock to process a specific block
    of our output matrix! But we have a different issue that is more subtle: Memory Access

    ### SUPER QUICK PRIMER ON GPUS ###
    Remember that the expensive part of our GPU compute typically comes down to loading 
    operations into our L2 Cache. 

    I really like this image to visualize it: https://supercomputingblog.com/cuda/cuda-memory-and-cache-architecture/

    Cache is the tiny bit of memory that sits between our cuda cores and the slower memory. 
    The amount of cache available is GPU dependent. For example, on my a6000 GPUs, I have:

    Memory: 48GB
    L1 Cache: 128kb (per SM) -> Each SM (streaming multiprocessor) is a group of cuda cores
    L2 Cache: 6mb

    So what are the differences here?
        Memory: This is the global (slow) memory on the GPU where it hold everything for the lifetime of the program
        Cache: A temporary scratchpad where we can copy data into from our slower Memory, but is temporary and managed automatically by CUDA
    
    The two different types of Cache are:

        L1 Cache is some memory for each SM to store the tiny bit of data it is processing. It is super fast
        but it local to that specific streaming multiprocessor

        L2 Cache is shared across ALL SMs on the GPU (slower than L1 but much faster than Memory). The benefit
        is multiple SMs can write to the same L2 cache at the same time, even through they are independent executions

    What we want to limit is repeated copying from Memory to Cache. These copies are expensive, and if we structure our problem 
    carefully we can potentially limit it! Ideally we can store something in Cache once, and then do lots of operations with it
    before we let it go (in triton we cant manually clear this, Tritons compiler does the heavy lifting for us!)
    
    TLDR: We want to maximize our Cache Hit Rate as much as possible! 

    ### BACK TO MATMUL ###

    In triton whenever we do tl.load() it essentially always is loading to cache. But, if it tires to load something, but it already has been loaded
    (potentially from a previous operation) then its a no-op! And we want to maximize this as much as possible, to reuse data already sitting in the 
    cache. 

    We are doing O = P @ Q

    P: [M x K]
    Q: [K x N]
    O: [M x N]

    And we saw ealier we want to organize it so every threadblock is processing a block of our output O
    Lets revisit this again, where each B is a Block of our output matrix. 

    [B11 B12 B13 B14]
    [B21 B22 B23 B24]
    [B31 B32 B33 B34]
    [B41 B42 B43 B44]

    So our BLOCK dimensions is 4 x 4 here, but each index represents BLOCK_SIZE_M x BLOCK_SIZE_N elements in our initial matrix

    Normally we process things in row major. We would in this case have 4 * 4 PIDs, and we would just go in order of 

    0 -> B11, 1 -> B12, 2 -> B13, 3 ->  B14, 4 -> B21, 5 -> B22, ...

    So our PIDs would simply be organized as:

    [0  1  2  3 ]
    [4  5  6  7 ]
    [8  9  10 11]
    [12 13 14 15]

    The issue is this, are we properly reusing data? We are processing things at the block level which is good, but 
    we may not be reusing stuff we copied to cache all that well. 

    Lets go Row Major to see what happens:

    ### BLOCK B11 (PID 0)###
    To compute B11 (the specfic block we are looking at), we need to copy in:

        Block of Rows from P -> P[0:BLOCK_SIZE_M, :] (the first BLOCK_SIZE_M ROWS and all the Columns)
        Block of Columns from Q -> Q[:, 0:BLOCK_SIZE_N] (the first BLOCK_SIZE_N COLUMNS and all the Rows)

        And we can do our tiny matmul on these two blocks of P and Q: block_p @ block_q -> [BLOCK_SIZE_M, K] @ [K, BLOCK_SIZE_N]

    ### BLOCK B12 (PID 1) ###
    To compute B12 (the specfic block we are looking at), we need to copy in:

        Block of Rows from P -> P[0:BLOCK_SIZE_M, :] (the first BLOCK_SIZE_M ROWS and all the Columns)
        Block of Columns from Q -> Q[:, BLOCK_SIZE_N:2*BLOCK_SIZE_N] (the second BLOCK_SIZE_N COLUMNS and all the Rows)

        WAIT! our Block of Rows from P is still P[0:BLOCK_SIZE_M, :], which is the same as before! So we get to use a Cached P
        but have to load a new Q. 


    ### BLOCK B13 (PID 2) ###
    To compute B12 (the specfic block we are looking at), we need to copy in:

        Block of Rows from P -> P[0:BLOCK_SIZE_M, :] (the first BLOCK_SIZE_M ROWS and all the Columns)
        Block of Columns from Q -> P[:, BLOCK_SIZE_N:2*BLOCK_SIZE_N] (the second BLOCK_SIZE_N COLUMNS and all the Rows)

        WAIT! our Block of Rows from P is still P[0:BLOCK_SIZE_M, :], which is the same as before! So we get to use a Cached P
        but have to load a new Q.

    ...

    What you will see here is we get to use our Cached P as we process PIDs 0,1,2,3 but load a new column BLOCK of Q for every PID. 
    
    ### PROBLEM NUMBER 1: CACHING GOES BOTH WAYS

    We only benifit from caching in one dimension. As we go across the rows, we get to reuse the cached P, but in the same way, 
    as we go across the column we could also reuse cached Qs.

    ### PROBLEM NUMBER 2: WE ONLY HAVE SO MUCH MEMORY

    At the end of all of this we wrote 4 blocks (the top row of blocks) to our output. To do this we had to load:

    BLOCK_SIZE_M * K values from P once and iteratively 4 * BLOCK_SIZE_N * K from Q. But Q is a K x N = K x 4*BLOCK_SIZE_N matrix. 
    Thats the entire Q matrix! And if Q is large enough, by the time we get to the end of our row of Blocks, the early rows will
    be released. (i.e. once we get to PID 3, due to cache limitations, the load of our first column block of Q could have been removed) 

    This means when we start on our second row at PID 4, we may have to RELOAD OUR FIRST COLUMN BLOCK OF Q!!

    ### PROBLEM NUMBER 3: MEMORY ACCESS PATTERNS

    Typically our matricies are stored in row major form. This means grabbing a row of data from the matrix is easy as 
    they will exist in consecutive memory positions. On the other hand, grabbing a column of data from the matrix is 
    much less efficient. As going down the column means getting every Nth element (assuming our matrix has N columns). 
    This means grabbing our column blocks from Q is much more expensive than grabbing Row Blocks from P. 


    ##### SOLUTION: GROUPED ORDERING ######

    What if instead of trying to compute our blocks like this (how we assign our PID to the different blocks):
    
    [0  1  2  3 ]
    [4  5  6  7 ]
    [8  9  10 11]
    [12 13 14 15]

    We did this instead:

    [0  2  4  6 ]
    [1  3  5  7 ]
    [8  10 12 14]
    [9  11 13 15]

    And to make it easier to see we can break it up like so (this is a group size of 2):

    [0  2  |  4  6 ]
    [1  3  |  5  7 ]
    ----------------
    [8  10 |  12 14]
    [9  11 |  13 15]

    Remember that each PID is responsible for its entire Block. All we have done is reorganize our PIDs so instead of
    traversing along a row of blocks, we instead group our blocks like so. 

    The execution order of our PIDs is based on the actual value of the PID. So PIDs 0,1,2 will occur before 13,14,15 for
    example. If we group our PIDs like this something really neat happens. Lets look at the top-left group


    ### BLOCK B11 (PID 0)###
    To compute B11 (the specfic block we are looking at), we need to copy in:

        Block of Rows from P -> P[0:BLOCK_SIZE_M, :] (the first BLOCK_SIZE_M ROWS and all the Columns)
        Block of Columns from Q -> Q[:, 0:BLOCK_SIZE_N] (the first BLOCK_SIZE_N COLUMNS and all the Rows)

        And we can do our tiny matmul on these two blocks of P and Q: block_p @ block_q -> [BLOCK_SIZE_M, K] @ [K, BLOCK_SIZE_N]

    ### BLOCK B21 (PID 1) ###
    To compute B21 (the specfic block we are looking at), we need to copy in:

        Block of Rows from P -> P[BLOCK_SIZE_M:2*BLOCK_SIZE_M, :] (the second BLOCK_SIZE_M ROWS and all the Columns)
        Block of Columns from Q -> Q[:, 0:BLOCK_SIZE_N] (the first BLOCK_SIZE_N COLUMNS and all the Rows)

        WAIT! our Block of Columns from Q is still  Q[:, 0:BLOCK_SIZE_N], which is the same as before! So we get to use a Cached Q
        but have to load a new P


    ### BLOCK B12 (PID 2) ###
    To compute B12 (the specfic block we are looking at), we need to copy in:

        Block of Rows from P -> P[0:BLOCK_SIZE_M, :] (the first BLOCK_SIZE_M ROWS and all the Columns)
        Block of Columns from Q -> Q[:, BLOCK_SIZE_N:2*BLOCK_SIZE_N] (the second BLOCK_SIZE_N COLUMNS and all the Rows)

        WAIT! our Block of Rows from P is still P[0:BLOCK_SIZE_M, :], which is the same as before (from PID 0)! So we get to use a Cached P
        but have to load a new Q.

    ### BLOCK B22 (PID 3) ###
    To compute B22 (the specfic block we are looking at), we need to copy in:

        Block of Rows from P -> P[BLOCK_SIZE_M:2*BLOCK_SIZE_M, :] (the second BLOCK_SIZE_M ROWS and all the Columns)
        Block of Columns from Q -> Q[:, BLOCK_SIZE_N:2*BLOCK_SIZE_N] (the second BLOCK_SIZE_N COLUMNS and all the Rows)
        
        WAIT! We have TWO REUSES NOW! We already loaded P[BLOCK_SIZE_M:2*BLOCK_SIZE_M, :] in PID 1 and we already loaded
        Q[:, BLOCK_SIZE_N:2*BLOCK_SIZE_N] in PID 2! We get to reuse both without any copying!
    

    ### SOLUTION TO PROBLEM 1: 
    We can see, now our caching can go both ways. We can reuse rows AND columns

    ### SOLUTION TO PROBLEM 2: 
    Because we have grouped things together that are close to each other, this maximizes the likelihood that when we go
    to do our operation, the data has already been copied in there, or we are copying it for reuse in an upcoming operation

    ### SOLUTION TO PROBLEM 3: 
    Notice that our grouping is:

    [0  2  |  4  6 ]
    [1  3  |  5  7 ]
    ----------------
    [8  10 |  12 14]
    [9  11 |  13 15]

    Not

    [0  1  |  4  5 ]
    [2  3  |  6  7 ]
    ----------------
    [8  9 |  12 13 ]
    [10 11 | 14 15 ]

    This is because like we discussed, accessing our column of data form Q is much more expensive than a row of data from P. 
    So we make sure we grab a column of Q once, complete all of our operations on it with easier to grab rows of P, before 
    we grab a new column

    At the end we still write 4 blocks to our output, but rather than a row of blocks, we are doing this grouping of blocks!

    ### CAVEAT ###
    We cannot explicitly tell CUDA to store specific things and remove specific things in Triton that easily. It is upto cuda
    to manage the cache for us. But by making consecutive threads have heavy overlap in the data that needs to be cached vs reloaded
    it makes it much more likely that the data that CUDA cached can be reused with an upcoming thread before it is cleared.

        ### is our starting row block. As we move down the rows, we may at the end not have
        ### GROUP_SIZE number of row blocks left (as its not perfectly divisble) so we just 
        ### update that here
        group_size_m = min(num_block_rows - first_pid_m, GROUP_SIZE)

        ### Now that we have our row we are working on we need the column. And as we saw
        ### we do column major order within groups. (this part is trickier)

        ### i % num_pid_in_group -> i can be anything from 0 to 15 in our setup and 
        ### num_pid_in_group is 8 for us. 
        ### if i == 0, i % 8 = 0
        ### if i == 1, i % 8 = 1
        ### if i == 2, i % 8 = 2
        ### ...
        ### if i == 7, i % 8 = 7
        ### if i == 8, i % 8 = 0
        ### Therefore, as our PID increases, we wil just go from 0 to 7 and then reset back to 0 again. 
        where_in_group = i % num_pid_in_group

        ### Now we need to get ourselves into the correct row, as its column major. This will be done 
        ### by doing where_in_group % group_size_m, where group_size_m = 2 for us 

        ### if i == 0, where_in_group = i % 8 = 0 % 2 = 0
        ### if i == 1, where_in_group = i % 8 = 1 % 2 = 1
        ### if i == 2, where_in_group = i % 8 = 2 % 2 = 0
        ### ...
        ### if i == 7, where_in_group = i % 8 = 7 % 2 = 1
        ### if i == 8, where_in_group = i % 8 = 0 % 2 = 0

        ### So we see toggle. i = 0 is placed in row 0 of our group.
        ###                   i = 1 is placed in row 1 of our group.
        ###                   i = 2 is placed in row 0 of our group again
        ###                   ...
        which_row = where_in_group % group_size_m

        ### And this is the row within the group, we just have to shift it over by where ever our starting group is
        pid_m = first_pid_m + which_row

        ### Now we get the column that this pid is supposed to compute. 
        ### we can just do first i % num_pid_in_group (same as before this is redundant)
        ### if i == 0, i % 8 = 0
        ### if i == 1, i % 8 = 1
        ### if i == 2, i % 8 = 2
        ### ...
        ### if i == 7, i % 8 = 7
        ### if i == 8, i % 8 = 0
        where_in_group = i % num_pid_in_group

        ### And just do division to get our actual row we are in!
        ### where_in_group // group_size_m
        ### if i == 0, where_in_group = i % 8 = 0 // 2 = 0
        ### if i == 1, where_in_group = i % 8 = 1 // 2 = 0
        ### if i == 2, where_in_group = i % 8 = 2 // 2 = 1
        ### if i == 3, where_in_group = i % 8 = 3 // 2 = 1
        ### if i == 4, where_in_group = i % 8 = 4 // 2 = 2
        ### if i == 5, where_in_group = i % 8 = 5 // 2 = 2
        ### ...
        pid_n = where_in_group // group_size_m
        ### so we can then construct:

        ### PID 0: (0,0)
        ### PID 1: (1,0)
        ### PID 2: (0,1)
        ### PID 3: (1,1)
        ### PID 4: (0,2)
        ### PID 5: (1,2)
        ### PID 6: (0,3)
        ### PID 7: (1,3)
        ### PID 8: (2,0)
        ### PID 9: (3,0)
        ### PID 10: (2,1)
        ### PID 11: (3,1)
        ### PID 12: (2,2)
        ### PID 13: (3,2)
        ### PID 14: (2,3)
        ### PID 15: (3,3)
        pid_visual[pid_m, pid_n] = i

        ### But we need to convert block_m, block_n to actual indexes in our data
        m = pid_m * BLOCK_SIZE_M
        n = pid_n * BLOCK_SIZE_N
